    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Neural networks can be difficult to understand and interpret, especially for those who are not familiar with the underlying mathematics and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Training time: Neural networks often require a lot of time and computational resources to train, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overfitting: Neural networks can be prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely, leading to poor performance on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Black box nature: Neural networks can be difficult to interpret because they function as a \"black box\" that takes inputs and produces outputs without providing a clear explanation of how they arrived at their conclusions.\n",

    "1. Biological neuron: A biological neuron is a fundamental unit of the nervous system in animals, including humans. It consists of a cell body, dendrites that receive signals from other neurons, an axon that transmits signals to other neurons, and synapses that connect the axon terminals of one neuron to the dendrites of another. When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, it produces an electrical impulse called an action potential, which travels down the axon and triggers the release of chemical neurotransmitters at the synapses. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the dendrites of other neurons, producing a new electrical signal and continuing the process of information transmission. Artificial neural networks are modeled after the structure and function of biological neurons, and use similar processes of receiving and transmitting signals to perform various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ReLU function: The rectified linear unit (ReLU) function is a popular activation function used in artificial neural networks. It is defined as the maximum between zero and the input value. In other words, if the input value is negative, the output is zero, and if the input value is positive, the output is equal to the input value. The ReLU function is preferred over other activation functions like the sigmoid or tanh function because it is computationally efficient and has been shown to perform well in many deep learning applications. One disadvantage of the ReLU function is that it can cause the problem of \"dying ReLUs\", where some neurons become permanently inactive due to having a negative input value for a prolonged period of time during training. This can be addressed by using variations of the ReLU function, such as the leaky ReLU or exponential linear unit (ELU) function.\n"
